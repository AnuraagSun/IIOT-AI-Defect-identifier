# IIOT+ AI Defect identifier project

## Project Overview

This project outlines how to build an IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) system for automated defect detection using a Raspberry Pi, its camera, and OpenCV (or alternative computer vision libraries). The system will capture images of products, analyze them for defects, and optionally separate defective items.  It also includes optional IIoT integration for data logging and remote monitoring.

## 1. Hardware Setup

*   **Raspberry Pi:** Model 3B+, 4, or 5 recommended for sufficient processing power.
*   **Raspberry Pi Camera Module:**  v2 or HQ camera recommended for better image quality.
*   **Power Supply:**  Appropriate power supply for the Raspberry Pi.
*   **MicroSD Card:**  At least 16GB, Class 10 or better.
*   **Lighting:** Consistent lighting is *crucial*. Consider a ring light or LED panel.
*   **Conveyor Belt (Optional):**  Mechanism to move products in front of the camera.
*   **Actuator (Optional):**  Servo motor, pneumatic cylinder, etc., to separate defective products.
*   **Enclosure (Optional):**  To protect the components.
*   **Network Connectivity (Optional):** Ethernet or Wi-Fi for IIoT functionality.

## 2. Software Setup

*   **Raspberry Pi OS:** (formerly Raspbian) - the operating system.
*   **Python:**  Programming language.
*   **OpenCV (cv2):**  Computer vision library.
*   **Deep Learning Framework (Optional):** TensorFlow, PyTorch (for advanced methods).
*   **MQTT Client Library (Optional):**  `paho-mqtt` for sending data to an IIoT platform.
*   **IIoT Platform (Optional):** AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub, ThingsBoard, Node-RED, etc.

## 3. Image Acquisition

*   Configure the Raspberry Pi camera.
*   Use Python code to capture images or video streams.

## 4. Image Preprocessing

*   **Resizing:**  Resize images to a consistent size.
*   **Grayscale Conversion:**  Convert to grayscale to simplify processing.
*   **Noise Reduction:**  Apply filters like Gaussian blur.
*   **Brightness/Contrast Adjustment:**  Enhance image visibility.
*   **Thresholding:**  Convert to black and white based on pixel intensity.
*   **Edge Detection:**  Use techniques like the Canny edge detector.

## 5. Defect Detection

### 5.a Traditional Computer Vision (OpenCV)

*   **Blob Detection:**  Identify connected regions of pixels (spots, holes).
*   **Contour Analysis:**  Find object outlines and analyze shape, size, area (cracks, deformations).
*   **Template Matching:**  Compare to a "golden sample" template.
*   **Feature Extraction:**  SIFT, SURF, ORB (more robust to lighting/viewpoint changes).

### 5.b Machine Learning/Deep Learning (TensorFlow/PyTorch)

*   **Image Classification:**  Classify images as "good" or "defective."
*   **Object Detection:**  Locate and classify defects within an image (bounding boxes).
*   **Semantic Segmentation:**  Classify each pixel as "defect" or "background."

## 6. Decision Making and Actuation

*   Based on defect detection, make a decision (good/defective).
*   Trigger an actuator to separate defective products (if applicable).

## 7. IIoT Integration (Optional)

*   Send data (defect count, images, timestamps) to an IIoT platform using MQTT.
*   Set up dashboards and alerts on the platform.
*   Enable remote control of the system (potentially).
